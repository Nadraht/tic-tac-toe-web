    <h2>Rules</h2>

    <section class="rules-section">
      <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game where you and the computer take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid.</p>

      <h3>🎯 Objective</h3>
      <p>The goal is to place three of your marks "X" in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before your opponent (the computer) does.</p>

      <h3>🕹️ How to Play</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Click on any empty square to make your move.</li>
        <li>The computer will automatically make its move after yours.</li>
        <li>The game ends when either player wins or when the board is full (a draw).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>🏆 Difficulty Levels</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Easy:</strong> The computer makes random moves.</li>
        <li><strong>Normal:</strong> The computer uses basic strategy to block or win.</li>
        <li><strong>Hard:</strong> The computer uses an advanced algorithm for optimal play.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📊 Scoring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Player win → +1 point to <strong>Player</strong></li>
        <li>Computer win → +1 point to <strong>Computer</strong></li>
        <li>Draw → +1 point to <strong>Draws</strong></li>
      </ul>
